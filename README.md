  Purpose
    - This program will create what is called a Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT). The tree starts at a root 	node and branches out a random locations based on a simple algorithm, and stops once a certain 	number of nodes have been added to the tree. The branches in the tree are all the same length 	(which is a parameter of the algorithm).
